[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2446x5ohw7wv0yy1?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sergipa/the-creator-3d)

This is a fork of "The Creator 3D", an university project to create a game engine.

The Creator 3D is a 3D engine made for educational purposes. This is an early version of the engine, the engine is subject to change.

## Usage

Download the latest release available, which may be found here: https://github.com/sergipa/The-Creator-3D/releases

Execute the engine, there is no formal installation process.

The engine contains FBX files and textures for testing purposes. To open an FBX you have to search it in the assets folder(bottom left), right click and press Load to scene.

You can rotate the camera by holding Mouse-Right Click, you may use W A S D to move it. While holding Shift the camera will move faster. The camera controls can be remapped.

On the top bar of the engine you will find different options to check the Performance, check system information, or change some of the settings of the engine (Window size, rendering options, editor style...)
